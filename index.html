I know we havenâ€™t been okay lately, especially with all the fighting and arguments. But I want you to know something very important â€” I love you. I love you more than our disagreements, more than our misunderstandings, and more than youâ€™ll ever know.

You mean the world to me, even during the times weâ€™re apart. I care about you more deeply than you probably realize.

This day â€” October 17 â€” means so much to me. It was the day I saw you. The day I fell in love with you. I still remember that meeting, the presidentâ€™s meeting or whatever it was called. Thatâ€™s where I first met you. You were so beautiful that I was honestly stunned. I didnâ€™t know how to approach you, but Iâ€™m so glad that I did. Because that moment changed everything.

I love you more than anything, and Iâ€™ll always care about you, even when I canâ€™t message you because of signal or other things. Please never doubt that. Youâ€™re always on my mind, even in the silence.

Iâ€™m sorry for all the times we fought, for the moments when you cried, for the times when your heart was shattered into a million pieces, and for the nights you thought about giving up on us. Iâ€™m sorry, my love.

Iâ€™m sorry for not being fully ready â€” financially, emotionally â€” and for not being able to keep up with your lifestyle sometimes. But please know that Iâ€™m trying, and Iâ€™ll keep trying, because youâ€™re worth every effort, every second, every heartbeat.

I love you, endlessly. Always have, always will. ðŸ’—`;
